## Question 1: Data Preparation with Command-Line Tools

File name: `prepare.sh`

Shell script runs the .py file to create the ms_data_dirty.csv. Cleaning and extracting the extra columns, did a visual review to ensure correct columns extracted. File saved. Used echo to create and write to insurance.lst for insurance_type. The summary output was number of visits and a header of 10. 

## Question 2: Data Analysis with Python

File name: `analyze_visits.py`

Data imported from the cleaned data and sorted. Duplicates in the file, if any, were dropped. Insurance ifnormation added and randomly assignted to patient dictionary. Costs were randomly assigned based on insurance_type. Calculated summary statistics including mean and age effects. A checkpoint was added at the end to ensure patient information was consistent. 

## Question 3: Statistical Analysis

File name: `stats_analysis.py`

Tests were assigned and run for analyzing walking speed and analyzing costs. Data was plotted for visual inspection for outliers. Advanced analysis looked at education and age interactions, with a printing of the results. 

## Question 4: Data Visualization 

File name: `visualize.ipynb`

Visualizations added for each of the analyses in a .ipynb.
